Thus,  the \ndistance travelled by a train to cross a  man or a tree or a lamp \npost  or  for  that  matter  any  stationary  point  is  its  length  itself \nand hence, the time taken can be obtained once the train's speed \nis known.","and hence, the time taken can be obtained once the train's speed \nis known. \nTime taken by a train to cross a stationary point = train length/train \nspeed \nIf the train has to cross a platform, it has to cover an additional \ndistance equal  to  the  platform  length.
